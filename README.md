Note Names
==============

A simple note naming quiz to help aspiring musicians read sheet music. Clef & range settings are encoded into the URL so it's easy to link someone to a specific setup.

## Example

## Disclaimer/Instructions

I'm a band teacher; I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing with TypeScript.

For example, I know you need to run  `npm install` after checking this out to get a bunch of dependencies, but I *don't* know why you then need to delete all instances of the word `export` from `howler/index.d.ts`. I just know it's my fault. Please explain/help me clean up this mess!
